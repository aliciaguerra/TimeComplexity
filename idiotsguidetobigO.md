#O(1): Constant Complexity
Constant. This means irrelevant of the size of the data set, the algorithm will always take constant time.
1 item takes 1 second, 10 items take 1 second, 100 items takes 1 second
It always takes the same amount of time.

#O(logn): Logarithmic Complexity
Not as good as constant, but still pretty good. The time taken increases size of the data set, but not proportionately so.
This means the algorithm takes longer per item on smaller datasets relative to larger ones.

1 item takes 1 second, 10 items takes 2 seconds, 100 items takes 3 seconds
